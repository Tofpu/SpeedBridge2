### Usage

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know**: You'll need a schematic for all of your islands. In addition, you'll need to ensure the schematics are placed on the WorldEdit/schematic folder.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Warning:** You'll need to set up a lobby before you can continue. Run `/sb setlobby`.
{% endhint %}

To set up an island, do the following:

1. Run `/sb create <slot> <schematic_name>` to create an island.
2. Run `/sb setup <slot>` to initiate a setup.
3. Find a suitable location for your island spawn point
4. Run `/sb setup setspawn` to set up the island spawn point.
5. Run `/sb setup finish` to complete the setup process.
6. You're done

To join an island, type `/join <slot|category>` or `/randomjoin`
