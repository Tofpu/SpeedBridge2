# CONTRIBUTING

## How to contribute?
1. Look for active issues, or missing feature that the you/community need(s).
2. Fork the project at the top right.
3. Create a branch that fits the nature of the PR (Example: teleport-bugfix-patch, spectator-feature-patch, etc).
4. Do your thing, then send a PR request.

**NOTE**: I __highly__ suggest you to consult Tofpu before you start. it's to not waste neither of our's time.
